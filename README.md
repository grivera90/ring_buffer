# Ring Buffer

This code is based on [AndersKaloer's repository](https://github.com/AndersKaloer/Ring-Buffer). It was modified as an improvement was the possibility of introducing in the buffer any type of data (void \*). This way it would be open to the user to define his own data type and make use of this module.

## Use

    // define your data type. For example:
    typedef struct  __attribute__ ((__packed__))
    {
        uint32_t can_id;
        uint8_t payload[8];
        uint8_t dlc;
    }can_msg_t;

    // in your app declare
    ring_buffer_t ring_buffer;
    can_msg_t mybuffer[8];

    // init your ring buffer
    ring_buffer_init(&ring_buffer, &mybuffer[0], sizeof(mybuffer), sizeof(can_msg_t));
    .
    .
    .

- Now you can use the function in ring_buffer.h to operate the ring buffer.

## Deployment

We use [Stable Mainline](https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-stable-mainline-branching-model-for-git/) for git workflow and branching model.
